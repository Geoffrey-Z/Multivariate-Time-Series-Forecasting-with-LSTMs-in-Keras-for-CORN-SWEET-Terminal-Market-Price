# Sweet Corn Terminal Price Forecasting with LSTMs in Keras
Weiling(Geoffrey) Zhu

## Abstract
This project implements a street sign Sweet Corn Terminal Price Forecasting using LSTMs in Keras. This project is written in Python 3. The `keras`, `tensorflow`, and `scikit-learn` packages were used to build the model. Data visualization and preprocessing was done with the `matplotlib` packages.

## Dataset

The following two datasets were considered for this project:

- [LISA Traffic Sign Dataset](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html) - a set of pictures and videos with annotated frames containing US traffic signs.
- [BelgiumTS Dataset](https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/) - a set of labelled pictures containing Belgium traffic signs.

The BelgiumTS dataset was selected due to its simplicity and smaller size. The LISA dataset is very large, and has far more data than is necessary for a small-scale project like this.
